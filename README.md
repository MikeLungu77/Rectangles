# Rectangles App

Very basic console app. Will attempt to create a Grid and two rectangles. For additional use cases please update the console Program.cs directly.

### How to run
#### In Visual Studio:

Open the Solution
Run using F5
The app will attempt to create a grid and two rectangles. The second rectangle will attempt to overlap the first, and program will display an error.
Further improvements. Change the UI from a console app to a nicer user interface. Add more unit tests.
